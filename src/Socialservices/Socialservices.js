        <h2>Health Camps</h2>
        <p>Zha Foundation recognizes the challenges of the underprivileged to access primary healthcare. We therefore organize free multispecialty health camps across geographies which includes a thorough check up by a doctor, distribution of free medicines along with specialized tests namely BP, Blood Sugar and Haemoglobin(Hb) monitoring. These timely interventions provide early diagnosis and treatment reducing the incidence of morbidity and mortality. Such health camps address immediate health care needs of the marginalized communities</p>

        <h2>Facilitate sports for youth wellness</h2>
        <p>Sport helps everyone and especially children and youth get fit, develop skills, make friends and learn to manage emotional highs and lows. Help your child be a good sport by being a good role model, encouraging a positive attitude and showing interest. Focus on effort, participation and fun, rather than on winning and losing. If children donâ€™t want to play sport, they have many other options for physical activity. Zha would conduct various competitions to help everyone in suburban and rural government school children for having a platform on having sports competition etc</p>
